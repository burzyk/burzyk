Hi! My name is Pawel and I'm a senior software developer at zagzig. I'm interested in everything that is IT related - from pure C# + .NET to node.js and MongoDB. I love new technologies and trying different things.

I have started programming back in the days when Delphi 7 was a big thing. I then moved on to C++, first Borland then Visual C++ 6.0. Eventually I ended up being a C# developer, but I try not to limit myself to Microsoft stack. I love writing in JavaScript, especially SPA-ish applications with AngularJS and I have recently taken up node.js. I even have some Android/JAVA experience.

If you want to know more about my skills please see my [linked-in profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pawel-burzynski/3a/3a6/776) or if you are one of the _show-me-teh-code_ people see my [github account](https://github.com/burzyk)
