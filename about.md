Hi! My name is Pawel and I'm a software developer. I'm interested in everything that is IT related - from pure ```C# + .NET``` to ```node.js and MongoDB```. I love new technologies and trying new things.

I have been working mainly with Microsoft technologies starting with Visual C++ 6.0 and currently developing with Visual Studio 2013 and .NET 4.5.1.

If you want to know more about my skills please see my [linked-in profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pawel-burzynski/3a/3a6/776)
