So I have created [burzyk.github.io](http://github.com/burzyk/burzyk.github.io) repository, initialized [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and started my own blog ... now what?

I guess it makes sense to write my first post. Because this is a software development related blog it feels right to start it with a good old **Hello World**

So in this hello world post I would like to write a few things about how I envision this creation. First of all I will be writing about software development. Technical stuff but also my observations as I go through the IT jungle.

I want to keep all posts simple and short. I don't like reading. I like pictures, diagrams and tables. It is easier to understand and saves a lot of time.

So to wrap things up - thanks for reading and stay tuned for more :)
